# About

Hello. This is the tiny space of the internet where I write words. Sometimes they'll be good, sometimes they'll be bad. Once, an internet friend told me, "You're a free thinker with a poetic streak and concise technical writing style," and that it's "God-given." So maybe more good than bad?

I'm generally interested in sports, music, social media, tech, daily fantasy sports[^1], and politics. Those all move at breakneck speed, so I'm also a news junkie.
