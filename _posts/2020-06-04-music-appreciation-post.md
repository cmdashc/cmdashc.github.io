I love how a lot of people say, "Oh I listen to everything!" and then they won't acknowledge certain genres of music at all. On the other hand, I'm that weirdo that says that and really does it. 

Naturally, with having an eclectic taste, listening to really trippy stuff happens sometimes. I've taken some knocks over the years when people have peeped my CD collection, or listened to my playlists. By knocks, I mean kids back when saying, "You listen to gay music," or "That's white music!" It's all good; I ain't one to hold grudges. Besides, I have receipts.
I can trace my influences, same way probably everyone does:

1. my parents
2. my uncles
3. high school

The above had a ton of influence on what I listen to today, and the I have a ton of gratitude for the foundation I was given to discern what's good music or not. 

So let's start with my mother. She's a singer, and has a short bio [here](https://www.reverbnation.com/denamoore/). Like many southern church-going kids, I (along with up to two of my other siblings at a time) was on the youth choir at her insistence. The only thing that differentiated us from all the other southern church-going kids who had mothers that insisted they be on the youth choir, my mother was the choir director for a time. She had that *juice*.

So we not only had rehearsals at church, but at home too. Bible study; open up with song, close out with song, then pray. It was kinda atypical in that there weren't lots of secular records stashed away in the bedroom; just classical music, but the OGs, like Handel and Bach. Otherwise, we kept it acapella with respect to my mother. I have to say that my singing career was briefly paused when I grew 8 inches, got some bass in my voice, and told her I was going to stop singing and play sports. I sometimes wonder if I broke her heart; I mean, it was a good run.

Second, my father; the drummer. What I've been told by my folks is that he beat a drum all through K-12, then beat it some more in college. For anyone who knows anything about music, you know that the drummer always gets some. I think the earliest memory I have of him playing was at this hole in the wall joint; some jazz and funk joints probably. I also remember riding in his non-heat having truck afterwards, freezing my ass off in my [Deray](https://twitter.com/deray/photo) vest. 

Anyway, as I've grown up, I've appreciated reflecting on listening to all the times I've heard him play. I swear this guy has the most natural sense of rhythm, keeping a tight pocket and dissing drummers who were out there "just stickin'."

Third, my uncles. I was born right around the time Atari was big, and I had an uncle who had one at grandma's house. So, he's my mom's baby brother, so he kind of got the slack that's allowed after you're parents are tired of tired of keeping all the older kids in line. [^1] It was after we got the Nintendo at our house, and he started taking me and my bro to Blockbuster, that I was opened up to the joys of 8-bit soundtracks. It's kinda terrible to think of now, but I can't shake the music of those Tetris stages TO THIS DAY. As if game wasn't addictive enough in itself; it just kinda wormed its way into my memory. 

While he played video games, this uncle was also kinda ham on the DJ tip. He introduced me to hip-hop. It was tracks like [Planet Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg2SW1oqSAk), [Egyptian Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbI2TS0fW4Q) and [Siberian Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiW7NbkhbJ0&) that hooked me in. I became a rap fan for life when I listened to [What's My Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbI2TS0fW4Q) on cassette. Ok, so the cover art wasn't mother-approved, so there's that.

I had another uncle, he was the second oldest; he went to Oakwood College to become a pastor. Now, I specifically mention Oakwood because if you do some Googling, you'll find some very talented people attended the school. In this case, he was adjacent to [Take 6](https://take6.com/bio/) and he brought some of that flavor back home with him. So, he has a tape deck in a small closet back in his room. He'd have friends over and they'd all go in recording acapella songs.

I was already pretty steeped in the gospel acapella, so like every choir lead (or Oakwood alum) that goes astray, I got into R&B music; Boyz II Men, Babyface, and I'm sure a handful of other groups that slip my mind right now. It ain't my go-to as an adult though (Dru Hill is near unlistenable to me because I can't tolerate Sisqo's voice anymore).

So last, you have my high school peers. I was put on a lot of music that hasn't aged well (rock-rap), and some that I still find myself rotating every once in awhile. My first intro to rock that I remember is Metallica's Black Album, the self-titled one. One of my roommates played it almost every night, and I'm not gonna lie, it was kinda annoying; but the solo on [Wherever I May Roam](https://youtu.be/S5TnPjOd_To?t=221) won my appreciation, and I began to tolerate guitars.[^2] So, after that, the System of a Down, the Linkin Park, and that one-off [Rammstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht_(Rammstein_album) album hit differently. No, no force of the cosmos will explain to you or me why I like [Du Hast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw_0JI9drWk) in either German or English.  

Even more unexplicable? I listened to KPop in my Korean friends dorm room, and no, I didn't understand a word of it. But it had its own appealing groove; and if you look at how big [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS) is today, and you might understand that the genre has a phenomenal fandom that crosses cultural and language boundaries. So, really, I was just ahead of my time.

As I wind this puppy down, it's not my entire history of music until I mention the Purple One himself; Prince. We were kids when we took road trips out to Alabama or up to Ohio; my mother's ex-husband would play those albums end to end. Maybe she might have hated it, but she knew and shared with me that Prince was adjacent to the SDA church. I guess that could've been why I connected with the lyrics of his songs; or it could've been that, coincidentally, my father also had all the Prince albums. I don't really know. What I do know is the funk and soul that ran though all his music; even the years he changed his name to a symbol. 

I kinda feel lame that I spent most of my mid-twenties catching up on Motown and Staxx, ect, like really hearing it for the first time. Yea, Soul Train came on during the Sabbath, so I wouldn't see that but once in a blue moon. But it's right there with hip-hop in my heirarchy.

So in short, if it's got a groove. Or stanky horns. Or Percussion (lots of it). Vocals in the mid- to lower registers. That sort of musicianship where they start really cuttin' up and just shoot the biggest, toothiest smiles at each other; you know, it's kinda ESP? All of that. That's my ish right there.

[^2]: It's 2020, do black folx like guitars yet? No? Ok, I have other takes you'll hate too.
