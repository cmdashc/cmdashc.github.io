# Welcome!

Two minds come with writing on the web. 

One goes, "Is anyone reading this? No? Then fxck it!" 

Two goes, "Once it's posted...it'll be ignored til an acquaintance or co-worker notices, and quickly, you've thrown your life and good name away because then it hits the news, then you lose your job, your mortgage, your wife, all 'cause you shared some toilet humor."

Some things are certain; death, taxes, and the internet never sleeping.

Good thing I don't need to wait for an editor.
